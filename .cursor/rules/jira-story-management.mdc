# Jira Story Management

Apply these conventions when creating, editing, or syncing user stories with Jira.

## Mockup vs. real product

- This repo (`shop-sales-routing`) is a **mockup**, not the real Fever Zone.
- Data models, field names, and state structures in the mockup are for demo purposes only.
- **Never put mockup implementation details** (field names, state keys, config flags) into user story acceptance criteria.

## Local files vs. Jira

- The `product-management/` folder is **local only** — it lives on the PM's machine and is not shared with the team in its native form.
- **Never reference local file paths** (e.g., `product-management/analytics-taxonomy.md`) in Jira descriptions, ACs, or DoD lines. The team cannot access them.
- In Jira, use generic phrasing like "per the agreed analytics taxonomy" instead of pointing to a file path.

## User story language

- Write at the **Product Manager level**: what the user needs and why.
- No code references, no data model assumptions, no tech stack specifics in ACs.
- Tech details are added later by the tech lead.

## Jira formatting

- **Title:** Short descriptive name only (e.g., "Multi-event transactions"). Not full user-story sentence.
- **Description:** Full "As a… I want… so that…" format, followed by acceptance criteria.
- **DoD:** Lives at the epic level, not on individual stories.
- **Descriptions use markdown**; the MCP server converts to ADF.

## Mockup walkthroughs in descriptions

- Reference the Vercel URL: `https://shops-sales-routing.vercel.app/box-office`
- Acknowledge the pre-populated initial state (cart has items on load).
- Keep walkthroughs brief (numbered steps).

## Scope boundaries

- Manage only stories/epics we created (POS Evolution, Sales Routing, Channel Visibility).
- **Do NOT modify** pre-existing Catalog Integration stories (B2BS-289, B2BS-910, B2BS-911, B2BS-912).

## Roadmap / Timeline management

- The Jira Timeline view reads **`customfield_11200`** for start dates and **`duedate`** for end dates.
- Other date fields (`customfield_11451`, `customfield_11215`) exist but are **not** used by the Timeline — do not rely on them.
- To set dates, use `editJiraIssue` with `fields: {"customfield_11200": "YYYY-MM-DD", "duedate": "YYYY-MM-DD"}`.
- Cloud ID: `8387c06f-8d18-40a7-ae38-180b03a43c8a`.
- When updating dates, also update the roadmap table in `product-management/workflow-and-conventions.md`.
- Sprints are two weeks long, starting Feb 23, 2026.
- **Do NOT set dates on Catalog Integration** (B2BS-863).

## Analytics conventions

- `product-management/analytics-taxonomy.md` defines **what** to track and **why**, organized by behavioral domain.
- Event names and properties in the taxonomy are **suggestions** — the tech lead reviews and finalizes them before implementation.
- Analytics requirements are **not** repeated in individual story ACs. Instead, every epic's DoD includes: "Relevant Mixpanel events instrumented per `product-management/analytics-taxonomy.md`."
- Retroactive tagging of the existing POS is handled by epic **B2BS-947** (POS Analytics Tagging).
- New features get tagged as part of their own epic via the shared DoD line (DRY).

## Sync process

- `product-management/` markdown files are the **source of truth**.
- Jira mirrors the markdown. Update markdown first, then sync to Jira.
- When updating the roadmap, update both `workflow-and-conventions.md` and Jira fields together.
- See `product-management/workflow-and-conventions.md` for the full pipeline and current roadmap table.
