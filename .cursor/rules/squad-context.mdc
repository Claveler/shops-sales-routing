# Squad Context

Andres Clavel is the Product Manager for two squads in the Fever organization:

- **Museums squad** — building a Donor Management Platform (CRM for museum fundraising). Mockup repo: `patron-profile`. Jira project: MSM.
- **Shops squad** — building POS and back-office capabilities for Fever shops. Mockup repo: `shop-sales-routing`. Jira project: B2BS.

Both squads share **Pablo Rubio Retolaza** as Product Designer (`712020:cad11526-b0ee-439c-8f58-bd790e994206`).

This repo belongs to the **Museums** squad.

Fever Zone is the partner-facing back-office of Fever. It is where the Donor Management Platform and the POS and its related back-office capabilities live.

## Cross-squad conventions

Both squads follow the same conventions documented in each repo's `product-management/workflow-and-conventions.md`:

- Epic description structure: Context, Why, Figma table, Mockup reference, Stories, DoD
- Design tasks: Story type with `[DESIGN]` prefix, one per epic, owned by Pablo
- MCP vs. REST API boundaries for Jira automation
- Markdown as source of truth, Jira as mirror

When making convention changes, consider whether the change should be applied to both repos to keep them aligned.
