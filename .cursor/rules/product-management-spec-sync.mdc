# Product Management Spec Sync

Whenever you make changes to UI behavior, UI structure, UX flows, or the overall description/scope of what is being built, you must update the docs in `product-management/` in the same task.

## Always update docs after relevant changes

- If changes affect sales routing, catalog integration, channels, warehouse logic, or related concepts, update `product-management/sales-routing-and-catalog-integration.md`.
- If changes affect POS layout, tabs, tile behavior, cart logic, permissions, or POS UX, update `product-management/fever-pos.md`.
- If a change impacts both domains, update both files.

## What counts as a triggering change

- UI changes: styles, spacing, layout, component structure, responsive behavior, interaction states.
- UX/flow changes: navigation, wizard steps, tab behavior, filtering, cart behavior, checkout flow.
- Product-definition changes: feature scope, naming, constraints, permissions, business rules, roadmap direction.

## Update quality bar

- Keep specs accurate to the implemented behavior and current product intent.
- Keep terminology consistent across both files.
- Update relevant sections only; do not add filler.
- Preserve independent-file structure and keep `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` untouched unless explicitly requested.
